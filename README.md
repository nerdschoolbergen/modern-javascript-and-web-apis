# Modern JavaScript and Web APIs

This workshop focuses on the new language constructs in the latest version of JavaScript known as ECMAScript2015 (ES2015) or ECMAScript 6 (ES6). We'll look at what problems these things solve, and also build a JavaScript-based web application against a server-side web API.

This workshop also covers more of working with web development in a browser development console.

This repository contains a link to a Google Presentation and three exercises.

## How to get started

* Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
* Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer, it's easier to read it on GitHub with formatting. We therefore recommend you keep a web browser tab open with the exercise tasks.
* Open [exercise 1](./exercise1/README.md/).
* Remember to ask an instructor if you're stuck.

## Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises organized in folders. Each folder contains a `README.md` describing the exercise.

* [Exercise 1](./exercise-1/README.md)
* [Exercise 2](./exercise-2/README.md)
* [Exercise 3](./exercise-3/README.md)
* [Exercise 4](./exercise-4/README.md)
* [Exercise 5](./exercise-5/README.md)
