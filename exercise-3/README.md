# Exercise 3 - First user interface

This exercise is focused on creating a nice user interface in order to display the movie data to the user. Since we prepared the serverside part in the last exercise, this exercise will focus on frontend code.

You will learn to:

- Create a list that displays the movie titles
- Create a grid of cards to display movie data
- Display movie posters in the cards

## 3.1 A simple list of movie titles

:book: In order to display a list of movie titles, we need some HTML. Bullet lists in HTML looks like this:

```html
<ul>
  <li>List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
  <li>List item 3</li>
</ul>
```

:book: Each `<li>` tag inside a `<ul>` represents a list item.

Visually it should look something like this in the browser:

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

### 3.1.1 Static vs. dynamic HTML

#### Static HTML

:book: Now we know what HTML we want to use to display the movie titles. But how do we actually insert the markup into the web page?

:pencil2: Open `index.html` and try creating a list like the one above. Place the markup inside the `<body>` tag.

:pencil2: Verify that the bullet list you created works by opening up the web app in Chrome.

:book: We could write a list of movie titles by hand and insert it into `index.html` like we just did, but since `index.html` is a static file the list would not stay updated if the data changes.

:pencil2: Remove the list you just inserted to get ready for the next part.

#### Dynamic HTML

:book: We want the movie list to change dynamically when the backend movie data changes. In order to do this, we need to _render_ the data into HTML dynamically in the frontend.

:book: Here is an overview of the steps required:

1. Frontend JavaScript code uses the `fetch` browser API to get JSON movie data from the backend API
1. Frontend JavaScript code converts JSON movie data to JavaScript objects representing movies
1. Frontend JavaScript code dynamically creates and inserts HTML with movie titles into the page

:book: We solved the first step and second step in the last exercise. The code should look something like this:

```javascript
const getMoviesApiResponse = await fetch('/movie');
const movieData = await getMoviesApiResponse.json();

const { movies } = movieData; // movies contains an array of movie objects
```

:book: Now we need to create some code that renders the data into HTML using the _DOM_ API.

##### What is the DOM?

:book: The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the structure and content of a document on the web.

:book: The DOM represents an HTML document in browser memory, and we can use the DOM API in the browser to manipulate the document.



:book: Consider the following HTML document:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello Nerdschool!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

:book: In the DOM, this document would be represented as a _tree structure_ of _nodes_, where `<html>` element would be the _root node_ and the `<body>` element would be a _child node_ of `<html>`.

:book: For example, to locate the `<h1>` element in the DOM, we can use the `queryselectorAll` DOM method on the `document` object:

```javascript
const h1 = document.querySelector('h1'); // Returns an DOM Element
console.log(h1.innerText); // innerText is a Element property containing the text of the node: 'Hello Nerdschool!'
```

:book: Common DOM API uses:

- Create new element
- Append element as child of existing element in document
- Remove elements
- Change existing element's contents
- Traverse elements

:bulb: Se [Introduction to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) on MDN for more info.

#### Accessing the DOM in our web app

:book: To create a bullet list we need to use the DOM API to:

1. Create a `<ul>` element to contain the movie list
1. Create `<li>` elements containing the movie titles we want to display
1. Append the `<li>` as children of the `<ul>` element

:pencil2: Create a new file called `dom.js` inside the `src/frontend/` foldert and insert the following function:

```javascript
export const createMovieList = (movies) => {
  const moviesList = document.createElement("ul");

  for (const movie of movies) {
    const movieListEntry = document.createElement("li");
    const { title } = movie;
    movieListEntry.innerText = title;
    moviesList.appendChild(movieListEntry);
  }

  return moviesList;
}
```

:book: Let's take a look at what this function does:

- It takes an array of `movies` as a parameter and returns an DOM Element (_renders_ data into HTML)
- It creates a `<ul>` DOM Element using the `createElement` DOM API method
- It iterates over the `movies` array and creates a  `<li>` Element for each movie
- The movie title for each movie is set as the `inneText` property value for each `<li>` Element
- Each `<li>` Element is appended as a child Element of the `<ul>` Element

Relevant API documentation:

- [document.createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) on MDN
- [Node.appendChild](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) on MDN
- [HTMLElement.innerText](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText) on MDN

:pencil2: Open `main.js` from the `/src/frontend` folder and add the following code to the top to import `createMovieList` from `dom.js`:

```javascript
import { createMovieList } from "./dom.js";
```

:pencil2: Add the following code after the `getMoviesFromApi` function call:

```javascript
const movieListContainer = document.getElementById("movie-list");
const moviesList = createMovieList(movies);
movieListContainer.appendChild(moviesList);
```

Let's break this code down:

- First we use `document.getElementById` to get a reference to an existing element with the id `movie-list`. Take a look at `frontend/index.html`, and you will notice an empty div:
  
  ```html
  <div id="movie-list"></div>
  ```
  
- We are going to append our movie list as a child of this div element.
- Next we call `createMovieList` using the result from `getMoviesFromApi`
- Lastly we call the `appendChild` method on our movie list div element using the result from `createMovieList`

:pencil2: Open up the web app in Chrome. You should now see a list of movies:

- The Godfather
- The Shawshank Redemption
- The Godfather Part II
- ...

:pencil2: Now that we have the basic pattern established, time to make the GUI a bit more interesting!

## 3.2 Create a grid of movie cards

In order to display our movie data we want to create a grid of movie cards, where each card displays the movie title and overview.

:book: To make this a bit easier we have prepared some CSS and a markup structure:

```html
<div id="{movie-id}" class="movie-card">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Movie title</h2>
      <p>Movie overview</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

:pencil2: First we need some code to create movie card elements. Add the following code to `dom.js`:

```javascript
const createMovieCard = (movie) => {
  const movieCard = document.createElement("div");
  movieCard.id = movie.id;
  movieCard.className = "movie-card";

  // Create a div container containing a header and a 
  // paragraph for the title and overview of a movie. 

  const contentContainer = document.createElement("div");
  contentContainer.className = "content";

  const movieHeader = document.createElement("h2");
  movieHeader.innerText = movie.title;

  const movieOverview = document.createElement("p");
  movieOverview.innerText = movie.overview;

  contentContainer.appendChild(movieHeader);
  contentContainer.appendChild(movieOverview);

  movieCard.appendChild(contentContainer);

  return movieCard;
}

export const createMovieCards = (movies) => {
  const movieCards = [];
  for (const movie of movies) {
    const movieCard = createMovieCard(movie);
    movieCards.push(movieCard);
  }

  return movieCards;
}
```

:book: `createMovieCard` is a function that takes a movie object as parameter and returns an HTML element with the structure previously described.

:book: `createMovieCards` is a function that takes an array of movie objects as parameter and returns an array of HTML elements.

:pencil2: Open `main.js` and add `createMovieCards` to the `dom.js` import statement at the top of the file:

```javascript
import { createMovieList, createMovieCards } from './dom.js';
```

:pencil2: At the bottom of the file, add the following code:

```javascript
const movieCardsContainer = document.getElementById("movie-cards");
const movieCards = createMovieCards(movies);
for(const movieCard of movieCards) {
  movieCardsContainer.appendChild(movieCard);
}
```

:book: This code calls `createMovieCards` with a list of movies from the API to create an array of HTML elements.

:book: It then iterates over the array and appends each element to a existing div element defined in `index.html` with the id `movie-cards`.

:pencil2: Open the web app in Chrome and verify that everything is working.

:pencil2: Notice that we still are rendering the bullet list. We donÂ´t need that list anymore, so go ahead and remove the bullet list-related code from `main.js` to remove it from the GUI.

## 3.3 Displaying movie posters

In order to make the GUI even more fun, we are going to add movie posters to each movie card.

:pencil2: Open `dom.js` and add the following code marked in green (without the `+`) to `createMovieCard`:

```diff
...
contentContainer.appendChild(movieHeader);
contentContainer.appendChild(movieOverview);

// Create a div container and a image element
// to position and show the image.

+ const movieImage = document.createElement("img");
+ movieImage.src = movie.posterUrl;

+ const imageContainer = document.createElement("div");
+ imageContainer.className = "image-container";

+ imageContainer.appendChild(movieImage);


// Add the containers containing the image 
// and text content to the card

+ movieCard.appendChild(imageContainer);
movieCard.appendChild(contentContainer);

return movieCard;
```

:book: This change will result in the HTML code for a movie card looking like this:

```html
<div id="{movie-id}" class="movie-card">
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="{movie-poster-url}" />
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Movie title</h2>
      <p>Movie overview</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

:book: Notice the new `image-container` div element with ang `img` element in it.

:pencil2: Open the web app in Chrome. You should now see movie posters for each movie displayed in each card.
