# Exercise 1 - Up and running

In this exercise you will set up the local development environment required for the next exercises.

You will learn to:

- Install the required software
- Set up and run the starter project

## Before you start

- :pencil2: Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer if you haven't done so already. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
- Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer, it's easier to read it on GitHub with formatting. We therefore recommend you keep a web browser tab open with the exercise tasks.

## 1.1 Installing software

### 1.1.1 Node.js

Node.js is the platform/runtime that's going to run our web server. You can test if you already have Node.js installed by opening a terminal and entering `node -v` which should return a version number if it's installed.

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can [download the latest LTS release here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

:exclamation: If you have Node installed with a version less than the latest LTS version, please upgrade to the latest LTS version before continuing.

### 1.1.2 Chrome

:pencil2: [Install Google Chrome if you don't have it](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)

## 1.2 Starter project

In order to kickstart the exercises we have created a starter project for you.

:pencil2: Open a terminal and change directories to the `src` folder.

:pencil2: Install all [npm](https://npmjs.com) dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
$ npm install
```

:pencil2: Run the following commands to start the web app:

```bash
$ npm start
```

:pencil2: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in Chrome

You should now see the text "Hello Nerdschool!" displayed on the screen.

:pencil2: To stop the application, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> while inside the terminal window you started the application in.

### 1.2.2 Starter project structure

```terminal
src
├── app.js
├── backend
├── frontend
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

#### `app.js`

This is the main entry point for the web app. It is responsible for starting up a web server using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web app framework.

#### `backend` (folder)

This folder contains backend-related code that runs on the web server via Express.

#### `frontend` (folder)

This folder contains frontend-related code that runs in the browser.

#### `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

`package.json` is the project mainfest file where all npm package dependencies are declared (for instance Express). `package-lock.json` is automatically generated by npm itself, no need to edit this.

### 1.3 Live reloading

:pencil2: Make sure the

Now that we're all set-up, let's implement some features!
